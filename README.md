# redshift-data-warehouse-project

## Project Overview
This project focuses on building a data warehouse solution using Amazon Redshift Serverless to support the analytics and reporting needs of an ecommerce business. The goal is to ingest data from various sources, transform and load it into a dimensional data model, and provide a foundation for generating key insights and business intelligence.

## Architecture
### Redshift Serverless Workgroup
- **Workgroup Name**: ecommerce-data-warehouse-workgroup
- **Base Capacity**: 128 Redshift Processing Units (RPUs)
- **Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)**: Default VPC
- **VPC Security Groups**: Default security group
- **Subnets**: Default subnets
- **Enhanced VPC Routing**: Enabled

### Data Ingestion
- **S3 Raw Data Bucket**: ecommerce-raw-data
- The raw data for the ecommerce business, such as customer orders, product information, and marketing campaign details, will be ingested into the "ecommerce-raw-data" S3 bucket from multiple source systems.

### ETL Pipeline
- The ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process will be developed using tools like Apache Airflow or AWS Glue. This pipeline will retrieve data from the S3 bucket, perform necessary transformations (e.g., data cleaning, aggregation, enrichment), and load the processed data into the Redshift data warehouse.
- Custom data quality checks will be implemented to ensure the integrity and accuracy of the data stored in the data warehouse.

### Data Warehouse Schema
- The data warehouse will follow a star schema design, with a central fact table (Orders) and several dimension tables (Customer, Product, Date, Sales Channel, Marketing Campaign).
- This schema design will enable efficient querying and reporting capabilities to support the ecommerce business requirements.

## IAM Roles
- **Redshift Default Role**: This role will have the necessary permissions to manage the Redshift Serverless workgroup, including creating and configuring the cluster, managing user access, and performing administrative tasks.

## Testing and Validation
- The ETL pipeline will undergo thorough testing to ensure data integrity and accuracy. This will include unit tests for individual transformations, integration tests for the end-to-end data flow, and data quality checks to validate the contents of the Redshift data warehouse.

## Deployment and Maintenance
- The Redshift Serverless workgroup and associated resources will be provisioned and configured through an automated deployment process,  using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools like AWS CloudFormation or Terraform.
- Ongoing monitoring and maintenance tasks will include monitoring Redshift performance, managing database backups, and applying any necessary software updates.

## Lessons Learned
- Documenting the design decisions and implementation details for this project has helped me better understand the complexities of building a scalable and efficient data warehouse solution.
- Navigating the various Redshift Serverless configuration options, such as workgroup settings and VPC setup, has provided valuable experience in infrastructure management for data engineering projects.

## Future Improvements
- Explore the integration of advanced analytics and machine learning capabilities to derive deeper insights from the ecommerce data.
- Investigate the use of Redshift Spectrum or external tables to enable querying of data stored in the S3 "ecommerce-raw-data" bucket directly from Redshift.
- Implement a more sophisticated data governance framework, including data lineage tracking and data access controls.

## Future Improvements
- Suggest potential areas for further enhancement or expansion of the data warehouse project.
